Plex Media Server is the backend for the Plex media system.

Plex's frontend media player, Plex Home Theater, is Windows/Mac only;
however, you can stream your local files on Linux from your web browser.
Plex Home Theater allows the user to manage and play video, photos, music,
and podcasts from a local or remote computer running Plex Media Server.
